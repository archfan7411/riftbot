# riftbot
Basic and easy-to-extend Discord bot.

# How to set up
To use RiftBot, you need a Discord application configured as a bot. To get one, go to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me, create a new application, and then create a Bot under the tab of that name. Customize the bot as required, and then save the token to your computer.

Then, download the RiftBot files in the directory of your choice by cloning the URL:
`git clone https://github.com/archfan7411/riftbot.git`

**Make a file, token.cfg, with the token you have saved, and run `chmod a+x restart.sh`**. To run the bot, do `python bot.py &`.

# Inviting your bot instance
To generate an invite link, go back to the developer dashboard (https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me), select your application, and go to the OAuth2 tab. Scroll down and edit the Scopes as required; a URL will then be generated below them. Copy and paste this URL into your browser and follow the instructions from then on.
